% Dear Hiring Manager,

% \bigskip
% I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineering Summer Scholar position at Deloitte Consulting. I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, with an expected graduation date of May 2024. As evidenced by my attached resume, I believe I possess the skills, experience, and motivation to thrive in this role.

% \bigskip
% As a firmware engineer intern at Oxit LLC, I gained hands-on experience developing embedded systems and IoT applications using technologies like LoRa and low-power RF communication. In this role, I designed module libraries to streamline embedded development across different chipsets. I also served as an AI research assistant at the UNC Charlotte TeCSAR lab, where I worked on an anomaly detection pipeline for public safety video analytics. These experiences allowed me to hone my software development and machine learning skills.

% \bigskip
% In addition to my work experience, I have undertaken several programming projects on my own initiative. For instance, I developed a Telegram-based automated 3D printing server for remote printing. I also created a real-time mask detection system using YOLO object detection models. Through projects like these, I have become proficient in languages like Python, C++, and PyTorch/TensorFlow machine learning frameworks.

% \bigskip
% I believe that my academic coursework has also prepared me well for this Software Engineering role. I have taken classes covering software engineering principles, data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and computer architecture. I am confident in my ability to apply this knowledge to develop robust and scalable cloud-native applications using agile methodologies.

% \bigskip
% I have also applied for your Business Technology Solutions Summer Scholar roles. I believe that my passion for learning new technologies paired with my engineering background enables me to thrive in a consulting environment, understand business needs, and deliver technological solutions. I am excited by the opportunity to gain well-rounded experience through a rotational program like Deloitte's.

% \bigskip
% In summary, I am eager to leverage my technical skills and continual drive to learn to deliver impactful solutions on diverse client engagements. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Deloitte Consulting as a Software Engineering or Business Technology Solutions Summer Scholar. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you.

% \bigskip
% Sincerely, \\
% Shenkai Xu
